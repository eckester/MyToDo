# MyToDo

For college students who need to be organized, OnTrack is a to do list that caters to a college studentâ€™s schedule. Unlike reminders, paper to-do lists, google calendar, etc, our product allows for prioritization, tasks categorization, and filtration.

  ## Code Standards 
  We are following the default Prettier code style, with no changes to the default guidelines. 
  
  We are using the eslint/recommmended. 
  - in the eslintrc.json file, under the "extends" section, include "plugin:react/recommended" and "plugin:prettier/recommended".

  To connect eslint and prettier, on command line run: 
  - npm install eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier prettier --save-dev
 
  ## IDE Plugins
  The only IDE used by some members of this project is VS Code, please refer to official documentations for other IDE's. 
  
  For VS Code: 
  - Install Prettier, Search for "Prettier - Code formatter" in the VS Code Extensions marketplace and install it.
  - Under Preferences: Search "Open User Settings", then search and check "format on save"
  - If you have other formatters: Search "Format Document", then select prettier as default

  Note: if you are not using an IDE, please refer to official documentation for running eslint and prettier on the command line.
