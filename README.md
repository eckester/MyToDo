# MyToDo

For college students who need to be organized, OnTrack is a to do list that caters to a college studentâ€™s schedule. Unlike reminders, paper to-do lists, google calendar, etc, our product allows for prioritization, tasks categorization, and filtration.

  ## Code Style and Guidelines 
  - We are following the default Prettier code style, with no changes to the default guidelines. 
  - We are using the eslint/recommmended: in the eslintrc.json file, under the "extends" section, we have "plugin:react/recommended" and "plugin:prettier/recommended".
